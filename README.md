# Sign_Language_Recognition
**Overview**
This project is a Sign Language Recognition system that utilizes machine learning to identify and interpret sign language gestures. Built using TensorFlow and OpenCV, this system is designed to help bridge the communication gap for individuals who use sign language.

Features
Real-time sign language detection
High accuracy using LSTM neural networks
User-friendly interface
Supports multiple sign languages
Technology Stack
TensorFlow: For machine learning model development
OpenCV: For image processing
Keras: High-level neural networks API
NumPy: For numerical operations
Python: Main programming language
